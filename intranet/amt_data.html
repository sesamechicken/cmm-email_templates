<p><b>Hello.</b><br><br>
  Your OMT Data is now ready for you on the Critical Mass Media website. Follow the directions here, or please feel free to contact me for one-on-one instructions.<BR><BR>
  First, make sure you are using the NEWEST version of the True Variety Music Software.  You'll know it's the latest when you see the "CMM" logo instead of the CD with music notes.  It will look like this when you browse to open the software -<BR><BR>

  On the Critical Mass Media website, log on and click on OMT DATA, then find your test.  Download and Install, as usual.  Once it is finished, click the "File" drop down list in the software and choose to ""Select Database"", navigate to c:\program files\critical mass media\omt data\(YOUR CALL LETTERS AND SEASON/YR)\, then double click on the file named &quot;<strong>TrueVariety.mdb</strong>&quot;. The screen will look blank, because the software is waiting for you to tell it what you want to see.  Generally, you'll want to see the main True View.  Click on "View", then "True View", and that page will load.<BR><BR>
  If you've already used our software, you may be good to go at this point.  If it's new to you, reach out and I'll walk you through all the things the software can do!<BR><BR>
  As always, feel free to call, IM or email for help with any of this.<BR><BR>
